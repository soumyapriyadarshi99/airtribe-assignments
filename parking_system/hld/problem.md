Objective:
Design the low-level architecture for a backend system of a smart parking lot. This system should handle vehicle entry and exit management, parking space allocation, and fee calculation.

Problem Statement:
Imagine a parking lot in an urban area with multiple floors and numerous parking spots. Your task is to create a low-level design for a system that efficiently manages the parking process. The system should automatically assign parking spots based on vehicle size and availability, track the time each vehicle spends in the parking lot, and calculate parking fees upon exit.

Functional Requirements:
1.Parking Spot Allocation: Automatically assign an available parking spot to a vehicle when it enters, based on the vehicleâ€™s size (e.g., motorcycle, car, bus).
2.Check-In and Check-Out: Record the entry and exit times of vehicles.
3.Parking Fee Calculation: Calculate fees based on the duration of stay and vehicle type.
4.Real-Time Availability Update: Update the availability of parking spots in real-time as vehicles enter and leave.

Design Aspects to Consider:
1.Data Model: Design a database schema to manage parking spots, vehicles, and parking transactions.
2.Algorithm for Spot Allocation: Develop an algorithm to efficiently assign parking spots to incoming vehicles.
3.Fee Calculation Logic: Implement logic to calculate fees based on parking duration and vehicle type.
4.Concurrency Handling: Ensure the system can handle multiple vehicles entering or exiting simultaneously.
